# Group Outing Itinerary Builder

ðŸš§ **Work in Progress** ðŸš§

This is a hackathon project focused on building an intelligent itinerary builder for group outings.

## Project Overview

The Group Outing Itinerary Builder aims to simplify the process of planning group activities by automatically generating optimized itineraries based on group preferences, location, budget, and time constraints.
